A small example on how to make drilldowns using angular-chart.js
Here is a link to a detailed [blog post](https://github.com/ShayD16/dashboard-demo) I wrote regarding how to use  drilldown's using angular-chart.js.

Please note that my requirement at the time needed only one level of drilldown, however, this code can be extended for multiple levels, with a little extra work.

### How To Run:
To run the demo simply install all the node and bower dependencies:

1.  npm install
2. bower install

And you're ready to go. Just run index.html in your browser.
